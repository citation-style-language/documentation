Introduction
------------

**Temporary Notice:** the changes described in this document are still in flux,
and only will become definite with the actual release of CSL 1.0.1. Please give
feedback via the referenced issue ticket, the `xbiblio mailing list
<https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/xbiblio-devel>`_, or the Zotero
forums.

These release notes describe the changes in Citation Style Language (CSL) 1.0.1
as compared to the CSL 1.0 schema and specification (2010-05-30 update). Many of
the new features listed here are described in more detail in the `draft CSL
1.0.1 specification <http://goo.gl/0UfDl>`_.

With minor exceptions (discussed below), CSL 1.0.1 is a backwards compatible
release, and valid CSL 1.0 styles and locale files will generally validate
against the CSL 1.0.1 schema and work with any CSL 1.0.1-compatible CSL
processor.

Cite Grouping
-------------

Within in-text citations, cites with identical names are sometimes grouped. E.g.
"(Doe 2001, Doe 2004, Smith 2002)" instead of a chronologically ordered "(Doe
2001, Smith 2002, Doe 2004)". We refer to this as "cite grouping". In CSL 1.0,
cite grouping was active when the ``collapse`` attribute on ``cs:citation`` was
used (with ``collapse`` set to "year", the previous example would group and
collapse to "(Doe 2001, 2004, Smith 2002)").

CSL 1.0.1 introduces a new attribute, ``cite-group-delimiter``, which can be
used on ``cs:citation`` to customize the delimiter for cites within cite groups
(the default cite delimiter is specified with ``delimiter`` on ``cs:layout``).
As an added benefit, because cite grouping is now activated whenever the
``cite-group-delimiter`` or ``collapse`` attribute is used, it is now also
possible to group cites without any cite collapsing taking place.

See `Cite Grouping <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#cite-grouping>`_ in the CSL 1.0.1
specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/52

"dataset" Item Type
-------------------

A new item type, "dataset", is available to describe datasets.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/74

Disambiguation
--------------

The default value of the ``givenname-disambiguation-rule`` attribute has been
changed from "all-names" to "by-cite". The latter is a less aggressive
disambiguation method that is limited to ambiguous cites.

See `Disambiguation <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#disambiguation>`_ in the CSL 1.0.1
specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/76

Input Data Model
----------------

The `CSL schema <https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema>`_ GitHub
repository now contains a JSON schema describing the CSL input data model
(csl-data.json, and, to describe the citation objects that are embedded in word
processor documents, csl-citation.json). At this point, it is modeled on the
input model used by `citeproc-js
<https://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/wiki/Home>`_. The schemas are not
necessarily complete and are not (yet) normative.

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/blob/master/csl-data.json
- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/blob/master/csl-citation.json

Line Spacing
------------

The minimum value for the ``line-spacing`` attribute has been increased to "1".

See `Whitespace <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#whitespace>`_ in the CSL 1.0.1
specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/73

Locale Metadata
---------------

Locale files may now include ``cs:info`` as the first child element of the
``cs:locale`` root element. This element may contain one or more
``cs:translator`` child elements, as well as a ``cs:rights`` and ``cs:updated``
child element. ``cs:translator`` can be used to specify the translator of the
locale file, using the same child elements available for ``cs:author`` and
``cs:contributor`` in styles: ``cs:name``, ``cs:email`` and ``cs:uri``. For
example:

.. sourcecode:: xml

    <locale>
      <info>
        <translator>
          <name>John Doe</name>
          <email>john.doe@domain.com</email>
        </translator>
        <rights license="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">This
        work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0
        License</rights>
        <updated>2011-10-10T23:31:02+00:00</updated>
      </info>
      ...
    </locale>

See `Locale Files - Structure <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#locale-files-structure>`_ in
the CSL 1.0.1 specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/10

Names
-----

Affixes on Name-parts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``prefix`` and ``suffix`` attributes are now also allowed on
``cs:name-part``, allowing for name formatting like "DOE (Jane)".

See `Name-part Formatting <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#name-part-formatting>`_ in the
CSL 1.0.1 specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/47

``cs:name`` Optional
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``cs:name`` element is no longer a required child element of ``cs:names``.

See `Name <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#name>`_ in the CSL 1.0.1 specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/53

``delimiter-precedes-et-al``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With CSL 1.0, the "et-al" and "and others" terms were always preceded by a space
when rendered as a result of et-al abbreviation. With the new optional
``delimiter-precedes-et-al`` attribute for ``cs:name``, the name delimiter can
be used instead (e.g. "Doe, et al. 2000" instead of "Doe et al. 2000").

See `Name <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#name>`_ in the CSL 1.0.1 specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/12

``delimiter-precedes-et-al`` and ``delimiter-precedes-last`` - "after-inverted-name"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new value has been added to the ``delimiter-precedes-et-al`` and
``delimiter-precedes-last`` attributes. With "after-inverted-name", the name
delimiter is only included before the "et-al" or "and" term when the preceding
name has been inverted as a result of the ``name-as-sort-order`` attribute.
E.g.:

::

    "Doe, J., and T. Williams"
    "Doe, J., S. Smith and T. Williams"

See `Name <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#name>`_ in the CSL 1.0.1 specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/97

Et-al Abbreviation with Last Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By using the new ``et-al-use-last`` attribute for ``cs:name``, it is now
possible to use et-al abbreviation and show the last author, as required by the
6th edition of APA Style. An ellipsis, preceded by the name delimiter, separates
the last name from the abbreviated name list, e.g.:

::

    A. Goffeau, B. G. Barrell, H. Bussey, R. W. Davis, B. Dujon, H. Feldmann, â€¦
    S. G. Oliver

The accompanying new ``names-use-last`` attribute for ``cs:key`` can be used to
override the value of ``et-al-use-last`` for sorting.

See `Name <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#name>`_ and `Sorting
<http://goo.gl/0UfDl#sorting>`_ in the CSL 1.0.1 specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/11

Independent ``names-min`` and ``names-use-first``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CSL schema now allows the ``names-min`` and ``names-use-first`` attributes
to be set independently on ``cs:key``.

See `Sorting <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#sorting>`_ in the CSL 1.0.1 specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/82

Normalizing Initials in "long" Form Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The new ``initialize`` attribute for ``cs:name`` can be set to "false" (the
default is "true") to stop ``initialize-with`` from activating name
initializing. In this case, the value of ``initialize-with`` is still appended
to initials already present in the "long" form of names. For example,

.. sourcecode:: xml

    <names variable="author">
      <name initialize-with=". " initialize="false"/>
    </names>

reformats the names "James T Kirk" and "Hunter S. Thompson" to "James T. Kirk"
and "Hunter S. Thompson".

See `Name <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#name>`_ in the CSL 1.0.1 specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/60

Subsequent Author Substitution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new attribute for ``cs:bibliography``, ``subsequent-author-substitute-rule``,
gives more options for subsequent author substitution. Whereas previously only
the whole name list could be substituted in case of a complete match, now names
can be substituted on an individual basis, even for incomplete matches for the
name list. For example, it is now possible to obtain bibliographic entries like:

::

    Doe, Johnson & Williams. 2001.
    --- & Smith. 2002.
    Doe, Stevens & Miller. 2003.
    ---, --- & ---. 2004.

See `Reference Grouping <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#reference-grouping>`_ in the CSL
1.0.1 specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/4

Numbers
-------

The rules for rendering number variables with ``cs:number`` have changed, as
have the criteria for the "is-numeric" condition. Multiple numbers are now
recognized as such (e.g., "2, 3 & 4"), as are numbers with affixes ("2E").

See `Number <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#number>`_ and `Choose
<http://goo.gl/0UfDl#choose>`_ in the CSL 1.0.1 specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/documentation/issues/6

Ordinals
--------

Gender-specific Ordinals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is now possible to define feminine, masculine and neuter variants of ordinal
suffixes, and specify the gender of the relevant CSL variables representing
nouns. For example, the English "1st" and "first" can now automatically localize
in French to "1er" and "premier" if the target noun is masculine (e.g., "1er
janvier" for "January 1st"), and "1re" and "premiÃ¨re" if the noun is feminine
(e.g., "1re Ã©dition" for "1st edition").

See `Gender-specific Ordinals <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#gender-specific-ordinals>`_
in the CSL 1.0.1 specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/7

Localization of Ordinals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To improve support for the localization of ordinals, such as "2nd" and "3rd",
the number of ordinal terms has been expanded, and a ``match`` attribute has
been introduced on ``cs:term``.

In addition, a ``limit-day-ordinals-to-day-1`` attribute has been added for use
on ``cs:style-options``. This localized option can be used to limit day ordinals
to the first day of the month when rendering date variables, as is required for
languages such as French.

See `Ordinal Suffixes <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#ordinal-suffixes>`_ and `Locale
Options <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#locale-options>`_ in the CSL 1.0.1 specification.

Tickets:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/66
- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/99

Page Range Formats
------------------

Page ranges can now be reformatted in the format used by the Oxford University
Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities (OSCOLA). With ``page-range-format``
set to "minimal-two", page ranges are abbreviated as with "minimal", except that
the second number keeps at least two digits for numbers of 10 and up (e.g.
"1-5", "20-28", "100-16").

Also, an error in the CSL 1.0 specification has been corrected: the "minimal"
page range format was previously mistakenly listed as "minimum".

See `Page Ranges <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#page-ranges>`_ in the CSL 1.0.1
specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/84

Specification
-------------

The CSL specification has been largely rewritten for improved precision and
clarity. There are several new paragraphs (e.g., `Terminology
<http://goo.gl/0UfDl#terminology>`_ and `File Types
<http://goo.gl/0UfDl#file-types>`_), and every `CSL variable
<http://goo.gl/0UfDl#appendix-iv-variables>`_ is now accompanied by a short
description.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/3 (variable descriptions)

Style Locale in Dependent Styles
--------------------------------

While it was already possible to set the ``default-locale`` attribute on
``cs:style`` in dependent styles, doing so had no effect. Now, when a dependent
style sets a style locale with ``default-locale``, this locale overrides the
style locale of the independent parent style.

See `The Root Element - cs:style
<http://goo.gl/0UfDl#the-root-element-cs-style>`_ in the CSL 1.0.1
specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/91

Style Metadata
--------------

eISSN
~~~~~

Previously, the ``cs:issn`` and ``cs:issnl`` elements could already be used to
indicate respectively the different ISSNs for journal-specific styles (e.g. of
the print and online editions), and the journal's ISSN-L. The new optional
``cs:eissn`` element allows the ISSN of the online edition (the eISSN) to be
explictly specified, e.g.:

.. sourcecode:: xml

    <info>
      <title>Applied and Environmental Microbiology</title>
      <issn>0099-2240</issn>
      <eissn>1098-5336</eissn>
    </info>

See `Info <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#info>`_ in the CSL 1.0.1 specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/51

License
~~~~~~~

The ``cs:rights`` element may now carry a ``license`` attribute to indicate the
URI of the style license, e.g.:

.. sourcecode:: xml

    <info>
      <rights license="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">This work
      is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0
      License</rights>
    </info>

See `Info <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#info>`_ in the CSL 1.0.1 specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/45

Short Title
~~~~~~~~~~~

The new optional ``cs:title-short`` element can be used to give a shortened
style title, e.g.:

.. sourcecode:: xml

    <info>
      <title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</title>
      <title-short>PNAS</title-short>
    </info>

See `Info <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#info>`_ in the CSL 1.0.1 specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/83

Terms
-----

New Terms: "available at", "scale", and "version"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Three new terms in the "miscellaneous" category are now available: "available
at", "scale" (accompanying the new "scale" variable), and "version".

See `Appendix II - Terms <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#appendix-ii-terms>`_ in the CSL
1.0.1 specification.

Tickets:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/90 ("available at")
- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/14 ("scale")
- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/98 ("version")

New Terms: "ordinal", "ordinal-00", and "ordinal-05" through "ordinal-99"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The terms "ordinal", "ordinal-00", and "ordinal-05" through "ordinal-99" are now
available to improve the `localization of ordinals`_.

See `Appendix II - Terms <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#appendix-ii-terms>`_ in the CSL
1.0.1 specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/66

New Term: "page-range-delimiter"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The new term "page-range-delimiter" makes it possible to customize (and
localize) the delimiter used for page ranges. The delimiter is only used when
the ``page-range-format`` attribute is set. As this term did not exist in CSL
1.0 and will be absent from CSL 1.0 locale files, it defaults to an en-dash if
not defined.

See `Page Ranges <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#page-ranges>`_ in the CSL 1.0.1
specification.

Tickets:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/56

Retired Terms: "field" Categories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CSL 1.0 locale files contained terms for all the field categories (the values of
the ``field`` attribute on ``cs:category``). While potentially useful (e.g. for
localizing a style browsing UI), they have been removed to make the locale files
more compact.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/100

Text Case
---------

The specification now describes how sentence and title case conversions work
(which are selected with the ``text-case`` attribute). Title casing is now
limited to items that can be assumed to be English.

In addition, the ``text-case`` attribute can now also be used on ``cs:date``.
This allows dates to be formatted as "April 2002" and "24 april 2002", where the
month is only capitalized in the absence of a preceding day.

See `Text-case <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#text-case>`_ in the CSL 1.0.1 specification.

Tickets:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/documentation/issues/13
- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/55

Validation
----------

The schema has become slightly stricter when it comes to style validation. While
this causes some backward incompatibility, the additional validation only
concerns attributes that had no logical use in CSL 1.0 styles, and shouldn't
affect any CSL 1.0 styles obtained from the `official CSL style repository
<https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles>`_.

No "verb" and "verb-short" Forms on Standalone ``cs:label``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is no longer allowed to set the ``form`` attribute to "verb" or "verb-short"
on standalone ``cs:label`` elements (these values are still allowed if
``cs:label`` is a child element of ``cs:names``).

See `Label <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#label>`_ in the CSL 1.0.1 specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/71

Tests for conditions on ``cs:if`` and ``cs:else-if``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the specification already required ``cs:if`` and ``cs:else-if`` to carry
at least one condition attribute, the CSL schema also validated cases where no
conditions were specified. This has been corrected.

See `Choose <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#choose>`_ in the CSL 1.0.1 specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/77

Variables
---------

More Number Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CSL variables "chapter-number", "collection-number" and "number-of-pages",
which previously were standard variables, have now become number variables. As a
result, they can now be rendered through either ``cs:number`` or ``cs:text``.

See `Number Variables <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#number-variables>`_ in the CSL 1.0.1
specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/9

New Variables: "container-title-short" and "title-short"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, "title" and "container-title" abbreviations were only accessible
through the "short" forms of these variables. As a result, it was impossible to
specifically test whether an abbreviation existed (``<if variable="title"/>``
tests "true" whether a "long" or "short" form of "title" exists).

Now, these abbreviations can also be accessed through the dedicated
"title-short" and "container-title-short" variables. For example,

.. sourcecode:: xml

    <choose>
      <if variable="title-short">
        <group delimiter=" ">
          <text variable="title-short"/>
          <text variable="title" prefix="(" suffix=")"/>
        </group>
      </if>
      <else>
        <text variable="title"/>
      </else>
    </choose>

would give title listings like:

::

    The Hobbit (The Hobbit, or There and Back Again)
    Lord of the Rings
    Free Culture (Free Culture: The Nature and Future of Creativity)

See `Standard Variables <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#standard-variables>`_ in the CSL
1.0.1 specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/2

New Variables: "dimensions", "director", "illustrator", "ISSN", "PMCID", "PMID", "scale", and "source"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New CSL variables have been introduced:

- "dimensions" - for physical (e.g., size of an object) or temporal (e.g., the
  running time of a movie) dimensions
- "director" - name variable for directors of e.g. films
- "illustrator" - name variable for illustrators of e.g. comics or children's
  books
- "ISSN" - International Standard Serial Number
- "PMCID" - PubMed Central reference number
- "PMID" - PubMed reference number
- "scale" - scale of e.g. a map
- "source" - origin of the item (e.g., a library catalog or database)

See `Standard Variables <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#standard-variables>`_ and `Name
Variables <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#name-variables>`_ in the CSL 1.0.1 specification.

Tickets:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/14 ("dimensions", "scale")
- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/96 ("director")

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/87 ("PMCID", "PMID")
- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/88 ("source")

New Variables: "reviewed-author" and "reviewed-title"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new name variable, "reviewed-author", and a new standard variable,
"reviewed-title", have been introduced for (basic) support of reviews (e.g.,
book reviews). These variables should be made available on the
"article-magazine", "article-newspaper", and "article-journal" item types.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/5

"sub verbo" Locator Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CSL 1.0 contained a bug: it was impossible to test for the "sub verbo" locator
type, because the value of the "locator" attribute is read as a list, and "sub
verbo" is read as "sub" and "verbo". To circumvent this limitation, "sub-verbo"
can now be used as a test value (the "sub verbo" term and input field remain
unchanged). An example:

.. sourcecode:: xml

    <choose>
      <if locator="page sub-verbo" match="any">
        ...
      </if>
    </choose>

See `Choose <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#choose>`_ in the CSL 1.0.1 specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/72

Using ``cs:label`` with Number Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``cs:label`` element, which previously could only be used for the "locator"
and "page" variables (and name variables, when used as a child element of
``cs:names``), can now be used with any number variable.

See `Label <http://goo.gl/0UfDl#label>`_ and `Number Variables
<http://goo.gl/0UfDl#number-variables>`_ in the CSL 1.0.1 specification.

Ticket:

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/8
