Introduction
------------

**Note: the changes listed below are still in flux, and only will become
definite with the actual release of CSL 1.0.1.**

This document describes the changes introduced with version 1.0.1 of the
Citation Style Language (CSL), as compared to version 1.0. For full details on
how to use new features, see the CSL 1.0.1 specification.

CSL 1.0.1 is a backwards compatible release, meaning that any valid CSL 1.0
style should validate against the CSL 1.0.1 schema and work with any CSL
1.0.1-compatible CSL processor.

Specification
-------------

The CSL specification has been largely rewritten for increased precision and
clarity. New sections include |link| `Terminology
<http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html#terminology>`_, |link|
`File Types
<http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html#file-types>`_, ...

Style Metadata
--------------

eISSN
~~~~~

Previously, the ``cs:issn`` and ``cs:issnl`` elements could already be used to
indicate respectively the different ISSNs for journal-specific styles (e.g. of
the print and online editions), and the journal's ISSN-L. The new optional
``cs:eissn`` element allows the ISSN of the online edition (the eISSN) to be
explictly specified, e.g.:

.. sourcecode:: xml

    <info>
      <title>Applied and Environmental Microbiology</title>
      <issn>0099-2240</issn>
      <eissn>1098-5336</eissn>
    </info>

https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/commit/74f6a4c75c0296a754d60aab0d127541d4c485a4

License
~~~~~~~

The ``cs:rights`` element may now carry a "license" attribute to indicate the
URI of the style license, e.g.:

.. sourcecode:: xml

    <info>
      <rights license="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">This work
      is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported
      License</rights>
    </info>

https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/commit/912ec31e3572d2b4ba4693bb4d83af3811af7509

Links
~~~~~

The CSL schema has become more strict about the use of the "rel" attribute on
``cs:link``. The values "independent-parent" and "template" are now only allowed
for dependent and independent styles, respectively.

Short Title
~~~~~~~~~~~

The new optional ``cs:title-short`` element can be used to give a shortened
style title, e.g.:

.. sourcecode:: xml

    <info>
      <title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</title>
      <title-short>PNAS</title-short>
    </info>

Updated
~~~~~~~

The ``cs:updated`` element has now become optional. The element may now also be
used without content (i.e. ``<updated/>`` or ``<updated></updated>``).

https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/commit/cab0cc6fae60771bfe9638d471f4f1bc4c75b4bf

Attributes on ``cs:style``
--------------------------

For dependent styles, ``cs:style`` may no longer carry the "default-locale"
attribute or any of the global options (the "demote-non-dropping-particle",
"initialize-with-hyphen", and "page-range-format" attributes) and inheritable
name options, whereas the "class" attribute has become optional (while "class"
has no function in dependent styles, it will only be disallowed in the next
backward incompatible CSL release, as it's a required attribute for CSL 1.0
styles).

Names
-----

Et-al Delimiter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, the "et-al" and "and others" terms were preceded by a space when
rendered as a result of et-al abbreviation. The new optional
"delimiter-precedes-et-al" attribute for ``cs:name`` allows the name delimiter
to be used instead (e.g. "Doe, et al. 2000" instead of "Doe et al. 2000"), with
control options similar to "delimiter-precedes-last".

See also http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html#name.

https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/commit/45f934d446849c394c4b5dbf0f3c9188f176ab98

Et-al Abbreviation with Last Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By using the new "et-al-use-last" attribute for ``cs:name``, it is now possible
to use et-al abbreviation and show the last author (as required by the 6th
edition of the APA style). In this case an ellipsis, preceded by the name
delimiter, replaces the "et-al" or "and others" term, e.g.:

::

    A. Goffeau, B. G. Barrell, H. Bussey, R. W. Davis, B. Dujon, H. Feldmann, â€¦
    S. G. Oliver

The accompanying "names-use-last" attribute for ``cs:key`` can be used to
override the value of "et-al-use-last" for sorting.

See also http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html#name.

https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/commit/f1407079ec0f53ae58cb70000139a38651366e87

Affixes on Name-parts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "prefix" and "suffix" attributes are now also allowed on ``cs:name-part``,
allowing for name formatting like "DOE (Jane)".

https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/commit/48c9abe5d7c917114e96d5b3068c803693e09841

``cs:name`` Optional
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``cs:name`` element is no longer a required child element of ``cs:names``.

https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/commit/cab0cc6fae60771bfe9638d471f4f1bc4c75b4bf

Independent "name-min" and "names-use-first"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CSL schema now allows the "name-min" and "names-use-first" attributes to be
set independently on ``cs:key``.

https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/commit/f1407079ec0f53ae58cb70000139a38651366e87

Input data model
----------------

The `CSL schema <https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema>`_ GitHub
repository now contains a JSON schema describing the CSL input data model
(csl-data.json, and, to describe the citation objects that are embedded in word
processor documents, csl-citation.json). At this point, it is modeled on the
input model used by citeproc-js. The schemas are not necessarily incomplete and
aren't normative.
