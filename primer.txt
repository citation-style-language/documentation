Introduction

Scope of this Primer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This primer is meant as a first introduction to the Citation Style Language
(CSL), and is primarily aimed towards those wishing to create or modify CSL
styles. Some knowledge about the structure of XML or HTML will come in handy. If
you are completely unfamiliar with either markup language, check out one of the
many online introductions to XML, e.g. W3Schools' `XML Tutorial
<http://www.w3schools.com/xml/>`_.

What is CSL?
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Citation Style Language (CSL) is an open and free XML-based language for
writing CSL styles, which describe how citations and bibliographies should be
formatted. Citing plays an important role in academic literature: it can be used
for attribution (which is important to avoid plagiarism), to give context to
your research, and to eliminate the need to repeat previously published results.

However, correctly citing sources is often far from trivial: the more popular
styles (e.g. *American Psychological Association (APA)*, *Chicago Manual of
Style* or *Modern Language Association (MLA)*) have extensive formatting
requirements, whereas many academic journals use custom in-house styles.

The Citation Style Language makes citing easier. With CSL styles and
CSL-compatible reference management software (such as Zotero or Mendeley), you
can automatically generate citations and bibliographies according to your style
of preference [#]_. You can also easily switch styles, e.g. when you decide to
submit your manuscript to a different journal. Finally, CSL offers advanced
localization support: with a single CSL style, you can format citations and
bibliographies in any of several dozen different languages, using localized
terms, date formats, and punctuation.

Different Classes of Citation Styles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before we leap into the world of CSL, let's take a look at the different types
of citation styles that are in use. Citation styles can be divided in two
main groups:

A) **"in-text"** styles: when a work is cited, a *citation* is added to the
   sentence. The citation points directly to an entry in the bibliography.
   
   Various types of "in-text" styles exist. The main types are:

   - **"author-date"** and **"author"** styles
     
     *Sentence* (author-date)
     
     Yeast cells were grown at 25°C in batch cultures on 0.5% methanol for 36
     hours (Gidijala et al. 2008) or in carbon-limited chemostat cultures (van
     der Klei et al. 1991; Zwart et al. 1983). [#]_
     
     *Sentence* (author)

   - **"label"** styles
   
     *Sentence*

B) **"note"** styles: when a work is cited, a *marker* is added to the sentence.
   The marker, a number or symbol, points to a foot or endnote. In contrast to
   in-text citations, foot or endnotes typically contain all information
   required to locate the cited work(s). Some "note" styles include a
   bibliography listing the cited works. An example of a note style:
   
    "In the Island of St. Kilda, according to Martin, [*]_ the men do not
    acquire beards until the age of thirty or upwards, and even then the beards
    are very thin. On the Europæo-Asiatic continent, beards prevail until we
    pass beyond India; though with the natives of Ceylon they are often absent,
    as was noticed in ancient times by Diodorus. [*]_" [#]_
    
    .. [*] 'Voyage to St. Kilda' (3rd edit. 1753), p. 37.
    .. [*] Sir J. E. Tennent, 'Ceylon,' vol. ii. 1859, p. 107.

          relation to sex. London: John Murray. 2nd ed., 15th thousand,
          http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F955&viewtype=image&pageseq=1.

In-text citations or foot and endnotes can reference multiple works. In CSL
jargon, the entire in-text citation or note is called the "citation". A
"citation" that references multiple works contains multiple "cites", with each
"cite" referencing a single work. Similarly, the "bibliography" contains a
"bibliographic entry" for each cited work.

Getting Started - A Basic CSL Style
-----------------------------------

Now that we've examined the different types of citation styles, it's time to
take a look at how these styles can be coded in CSL. We'll start with dissecting
a simple CSL style in the "author-date" format that describes the formatting of
journal articles:

.. sourcecode:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <style xmlns="http://purl.org/net/xbiblio/csl" version="1.0"
    class="in-text">
      <info>
        <title>My First Style</title>
        <id>my-first-style</id>
        <updated>2008-10-29T21:01:24+00:00</updated>
      </info>
      <macro name="author-short">
        <names variable="author">
          <name form="short"/>
        </names>
      </macro>
      <macro name="author">
        <names variable="author">
          <name name-as-sort-order="all" initialize-with=". "/>
        </names>
      </macro>
      <macro name="issued">
        <date variable="issued">
          <date-part name="year"/>
        </date>
      </macro>
      <citation>
        <sort>
          <key macro="issued"/>
          <key macro="author-short"/>
        </sort>
        <layout prefix="(" suffix=")" delimiter="; ">
          <text macro="author-short"/>
          <text macro="issued" prefix=" "/>
        </layout>
      </citation>
      <bibliography>
        <sort>
          <key macro="author"/>
          <key macro="issued"/>
        </sort>
        <layout suffix=".">
          <group delimiter=" ">
            <text macro="author"/>
            <text macro="issued" prefix="(" suffix=")"/>
            <text variable="title" suffix="."/>
            <text variable="container-title" font-style="italic"/>
          </group>
          <group prefix=", ">
            <text variable="volume" suffix=":"/>
            <text variable="page"/>
          </group>
        </layout>
      </bibliography>
    </style>

So, what do we've got here? We can divide this style in the following parts:

XML Declaration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. sourcecode:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

The first line of the style is the *XML declaration*, and tells you that the
style is written according to the XML specification (remember that CSL is an
XML-based language).

Style
~~~~~

.. sourcecode:: xml

    <style xmlns="http://purl.org/net/xbiblio/csl" version="1.0"
    class="in-text">
      ...
    </style>

``style`` is the *root element* of the style. The *attributes* on this *element*
specify that a) all the elements in the style are part of the CSL schema
(``xmlns="http://purl.org/net/xbiblio/csl"``), b) that the style is compatible
with CSL 1.0 (``version="1.0"``) and c) that the CSL style is of the "in-text"
type (``class="in-text"``).

Info
~~~~

.. sourcecode:: xml

      <info>
        <title>My First Style</title>
        <id>my-first-style</id>
        <updated>2008-10-29T21:01:24+00:00</updated>
      </info>

The first *child element* of the ``style`` root element is ``info``. The
``info`` element contains information about the style. In this case the *child
elements* of ``info`` give the style title, an ID to identify the style and the
date and time the style was last updated.

Citation
~~~~~~~~

.. sourcecode:: xml

      <citation>
        <sort>
          <key macro="issued"/>
          <key macro="author-short"/>
        </sort>
        <layout prefix="(" suffix=")" delimiter="; ">
          <text macro="author-short"/>
          <text macro="issued" prefix=" "/>
        </layout>
      </citation>

Skipping the ``macro`` elements for now, we reach the ``citation`` element. This
element describes how the in-text citations should be formatted. The ``layout``
element specifies that each *citation* should be wrapped in parentheses
(``prefix="(" suffix=")"``), and that *cites* in a citation should be delimited
by "; ". Each *cite* shows of the output of two macros: "author-short" (``<text
macro="author-short"/>``), which renders the author surnames, and "issued"
(``<text macro="issued"/>``), which renders the year of issue. The output of the
"issued" macro is preceded by a space (``prefix=" "``). This *layout* element
could produce in-text citations like:

    (Doe 1999)

and

    (Hayden, Scott, Muffley 1980; Strangelove 1964; Mandrake 1964)

The ``sort`` element specifies how cites within a citation are sorted. In
our case, cites are first sorted by the year of issue, and then by the author
surnames. This changes the example citation above to:

    (Mandrake 1964; Strangelove 1964; Hayden, Scott, Muffley 1980)

Bibliography
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. sourcecode:: xml

      <bibliography>
        <sort>
          <key macro="author"/>
          <key macro="issued"/>
        </sort>
        <layout suffix=".">
          <group delimiter=" ">
            <text macro="author"/>
            <text macro="issued" prefix="(" suffix=")"/>
            <text variable="title" suffix="."/>
            <text variable="container-title" font-style="italic"/>
          </group>
          <group prefix=", ">
            <text variable="volume" suffix=":"/>
            <text variable="page"/>
          </group>
        </layout>
      </bibliography>

The ``bibliography`` element describes the formatting of bibliographic entries,
and functions very similar to the ``citation`` element. The "author" macro shows
the given and surnames of the authors. The next three ``text`` elements output
respectively the year of issue, the article title and, in italics, the title of
the journal. The four ``text`` elements are wrapped in a ``group`` element, and
the output of the different elements is separated by a space. Then, preceded by
", ", the journal volume and the pages of the article are rendered. Each
bibliographic entry ends with a period. The ``sort`` element at the beginning of
the ``bibliography`` element specifies that bibliographic entries should first
be sorted by the author names, and then by the year of issue. This code could
results in bibliographic entries like:

    Hayden, S., Scott, G. C., Muffley, M. (1980) How to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. *Nuclear Journal*, 15:548-553.

    Mandrake, L. (1964) Improving the Management of Recall Codes. *Journal of International Strategics*, 8:2790-795.

    Strangelove (1964) Nuclear War and How to Prevent It. *War Games*, 2:23-25.

Macros
~~~~~~

.. sourcecode:: xml

      <macro name="author-short">
        <names variable="author">
          <name form="short"/>
        </names>
      </macro>
      <macro name="author">
        <names variable="author">
          <name name-as-sort-order="all" initialize-with=". "/>
        </names>
      </macro>
      <macro name="issued">
        <date variable="issued">
          <date-part name="year"/>
        </date>
      </macro>

So what exactly happens in these macros? The main purpose of macros is to reuse
formatting instructions. E.g. in our style, the "author-short" macro is used
both for rendering (``<text macro="author-short"/>``) and for sorting (``<key
macro="author-short"/>``). By using macros, styles are more compact and easier
to maintain. The three macros have the following output:

* the "author-short" macro lists a ``names`` element, which renders all the
  names stored in the "author" variable. The ``name`` child element of ``names``
  specifies that each name should be shown in its "short" form, i.e. only the
  surname should be shown).

* the "author" macro is very similar to the "author-short" macro. However, here
  the author names are shown in their default "long" form, i.e. with both the
  given and surname. All names are inverted (``name-as-sort-order="all"``), with
  the surname preceding the given name (e.g. "Doe, John"). Given names are
  initialized (``initialize-with=". "``), with initials being separated by ". "
  (e.g. "Doe, J. R.")

* the "issued" macro lists a ``date`` element, which renders the date stored in
  the "issued" variable. As only a ``date-part`` child element is included for
  "year", only the year of issue is shown.

Editing Styles
--------------

After using the above CSL style for a while, you notice you've been missing
something. Wouldn't it be nice to include the DOI (digital object identifier) to
the bibliographic entries? Although dedicated tools for editing CSL styles have
yet to be released, you can already edit styles using a simple text editor.

In CSL, the DOI is stored in the "DOI" variable. So, to append the DOI to each
bibliographic entry, we can use the following code for the bibliography:

.. sourcecode:: xml

      <bibliography>
        <sort>
          <key macro="author"/>
          <key macro="issued"/>
        </sort>
        <layout suffix=".">
          <group delimiter=" ">
            <text macro="author"/>
            <text macro="issued" prefix="(" suffix=")"/>
            <text variable="title" suffix="."/>
            <text variable="container-title" font-style="italic"/>
          </group>
          <group prefix=", ">
            <text variable="volume" suffix=":"/>
            <text variable="page"/>
          </group>
          <text variable="doi" prefix=", "/>
        </layout>
      </bibliography>

This should now result in entries like:

    Strangelove (1964) Nuclear War and How to Prevent It. *War Games*, 2:23-25,
    10.1234/WG.002-23.

Validation
~~~~~~~~~~

After making changes to a CSL style, it is always a good idea to check whether
the style still *validates*. Correct processing of CSL styles requires that CSL
styles are both written in correct XML and conform to the CSL schema. Both these
checks can be performed with an XML validator. Here we will use the
online validator `Validator.nu <http://validator.nu/>`_:

1. Select the style you want to validate. When using "Address" option, provide
   the URL to the style and check the "Be lax about HTTP Content-Type"
   check-box. With "File Upload", select the style file on your computer. With
   "Text Field", paste the style code into the text box and select the "XML;
   don't load external entities" option for the "Parser" drop-down menu.
   
2. Paste the URL to the CSL 1.0 schema into the "Schemas" text field:
   https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/v1.0/csl.rnc
   
3. Click the "Validate" button.

When we perform these steps, we get an error:

    | Error: Bad value doi for attribute variable on element text from namespace http://purl.org/net/xbiblio/csl.
    | From line 50, column 7; to line 50, column 40
    | up>\ |return| <text variable="doi" prefix=", "/>\ |return| <

.. |return| unicode:: U+21a9

Oops! It seems that "doi" is an invalid variable name. After checking the
`CSL 1.0 specification`_, we discover that the variable name should be
capitalized ("DOI"). When we make this correction (``<text variable="DOI"
prefix=", "/>``) and run the validation again, we get the message:

    | The document validates according to the specified schema(s).

As you see, validation is a powerful tool to help you find and eliminate typing
errors and other mistakes in CSL styles.

Learning More
-------------

You now know the purpose of the Citation Style Language and the basic structure
of CSL 1.0 styles. To learn more, browse the documentation at
`CitationStyles.org <http://citationstyles.org>`_. In addition to reading the
`CSL 1.0 specification`_, it can be very useful to take a look at other
CSL 1.0 styles.
